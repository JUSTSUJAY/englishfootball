# The Fjelstul English Football Database

The Fjelstul English Football Database is a comprehensive database of football matches played in the Premier League and the English Football League from the 1888-89 inaugural season of the Football League through through the 2021-22 season. The database was created by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D. The database contains `5` datasets: `seasons`, `teams`, `matches`, `appearances` (one observation per team per match), and `standings` (end-of-the-season league tables). The `matches` dataset includes `203956` matches.

## Downloading the codebook

The codebook for the database is available in `.pdf` format in the `codebook/pdf/` folder. The codebook is also available in `.csv` format in the `codebook/csv/` folder. There are `2` files: `datasets.csv`, which describes the contents of each dataset, and `variables.csv`, which describes each variable. 

The codebook for the database is also included in the `R` package: `englishfootball::datasets` and `englishfootball::variables`. The same information is also available as part of the `R` documentation for each dataset. For example, you can see the codebook for the `englishfootball::matches` dataset by running `?englishfootball::matches`.

## Data notes

- **Cross-validation.** I collected the data for the `matches` dataset separately from the data for the `standings` dataset (i.e., the `standings` table is not calculated based on the `matches` dataset). This allowed me to cross-reference the `matches` and `standings` datasets to make sure that the sum of all points earned by each team in each season, based on match result data in the `matches` dataset, equals the team's end-of-the-season point total in the `standings` dataset, accounting for (a) point adjustments due to deductions and forfeits and (b) matches that were expunged due to teams resigning from the league or being expelled from the league. I also confirm the `goals_for` and `goals_against` variables in the `standings` dataset.
